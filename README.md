# pytext2html-CLI
a fork of https://github.com/davidbarkhuizen/pytxt2html

I prefer `<p>` tags to `<br>` and instead of coding in the source file, I've made it and the destination html file arguments to the command line.
Plan to clean it up more to take rough OCR'd documents and create decent html files to be converted into .mobi or .epub books using something like Calibre.
